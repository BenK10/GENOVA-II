# GENOVA-II
the evolution of GENOVA

GENOVA-II is the evolution of the GENOVA project, a genetic algorithm designer. 
Re-implementing it in LISP allows dispensing with the complexity and limitations of scripts and instead
providing "scripts" in LISP itself. This allows GENOVA to be:

-minimalist. Only a core engine need be implemented

-extensible. Users can supply their own definitions for all the key genetic algorithm functions

-runtime-modifiable. It is Lisp, after all.
